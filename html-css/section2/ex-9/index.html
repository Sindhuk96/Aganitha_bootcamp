<h4>Planetarium</h4>
<p>A planetarium is a building or room with a curved ceiling that shows images of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. The images are projected onto the ceiling using lights to represent how the planets and stars appear to move. Planetariums are used for education and entertainment, and can host school field trips and laser light rock shows</p>
