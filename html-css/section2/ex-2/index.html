        Character encoding refers to the method used to represent characters, symbols, and text in digital form. There are many different character encoding standards, each with its own unique way of mapping characters to binary data. Some of the most common character encoding types include:
        <br>
        <br>
        UTF-8: UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit) is one of the most widely used character encodings. It can represent the entire Unicode character set, making it suitable for various languages and scripts. It uses a variable-length encoding, which means that it can represent characters with 8, 16, or 24 bits.
        <br>
        <br>
        UTF-16: UTF-16 is another Unicode-based encoding that uses 16 bits per character. It can represent the entire Unicode character set and is often used in applications that require fixed-width character encoding.
        <br>
        <br>
        UTF-32: UTF-32 uses a fixed 32-bit encoding for each character, making it capable of representing the entire Unicode character set with a consistent encoding size.
        <br>
        <br>
        ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1): ISO 8859-1 is a character encoding that covers the characters commonly used in Western European languages. It uses a single byte per character and includes characters like the Latin alphabet, common diacritics, and some symbols.
        <br>
        <br>
        Windows-1252: This character encoding is an extension of ISO 8859-1 and is commonly used for Windows systems. It includes additional characters not found in ISO 8859-1.
        <br>
        <br>
        ASCII: ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is one of the earliest character encodings. It uses 7 bits to represent 128 characters, primarily consisting of the English alphabet, numerals, and common symbols.
        <br>
        <br>
        EUC (Extended Unix Code): EUC is a multibyte character encoding commonly used in Unix and Linux systems. It supports various Asian character sets by using variable-length encoding.
        <br>
        <br>
        Shift JIS: Shift JIS is a character encoding used for the Japanese language. It uses variable-length encoding and is common in Japanese operating systems and software.
        <br>
        <br>
        GB2312 and GBK: These character encodings are used for the simplified Chinese language. GB2312 is an older standard, while GBK is an extension that adds more characters.
        <br>
        <br>
        Big5: Big5 is a character encoding used for traditional Chinese characters, mainly in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
        <br>
        <br>
        ISO-2022: ISO-2022 is a character encoding used for representing text in various character sets, and it can switch between different encodings within the same document.
        <br>
        <br>
        MBCS (Multi-Byte Character Set): MBCS is a term that refers to character encodings that use variable-length encoding to represent characters from multiple character sets, such as Double-Byte Character Sets (DBCS) for Asian languages.
        <br>
        <br>
        The choice of character encoding depends on the specific needs of a project, the languages and scripts you intend to support, and the compatibility requirements with different systems and software. UTF-8 and UTF-16 are popular choices for supporting a wide range of languages and are often used in modern web applications.
