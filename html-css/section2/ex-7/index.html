            As Delhi pollution worsens, environment minister Gopal Rai said the government will take a decision on odd-even if the situation turns very serious.

            "In 2015, out of 365 days, only 109 days in Delhi experienced good air quality. Last year, the number was 163 and this year the number is over 200. But yes, it is a task to manage the air quality in the first week of November. But the weather condition is also liable for this," the minister said.

            All primary schools in Delhi have been shut for two days -- Friday and Saturday -- as the air quality suddenly deteriorated from Thursday evening.

            The minister said the government is not delaying the implementation of odd-even. "The Supreme Court has given the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) the mandate to take the decision. According to their direction, we are moving our steps. If the situation turns very serious, then we will take further decisions after discussing it with everyone," the minister said.
