        <section id="layer7">
        <h2 >Layer 7. The application layer </h2>
        <p>The application layer enables the user -- human or software -- to interact with the application or network whenever the user elects to read messages, transfer files or perform other network-related tasks. Web browsers and other internet-connected apps, such as Outlook and Skype, use Layer 7 application protocols.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="layer6">
            <h2 >Layer 6. The presentation layer </h2>
            <p>The presentation layer translates or formats data for the application layer based on the semantics or syntax the application accepts. This layer also handles the encryption and decryption that the application layer requires.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="layer5">
            <h2 >Layer 5. The session layer </h2>
            <p>The session layer sets up, coordinates and terminates conversations between applications. Its services include authentication and reconnection after an interruption. This layer determines how long a system will wait for another application to respond. Examples of session layer protocols include X.225 and Zone Information Protocol (ZIP).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="layer4">
            <h2 >Layer 4. The transport layer </h2>
            <p>The transport layer is responsible for transferring data across a network and provides error-checking mechanisms and data flow controls. It determines how much data to send, where it gets sent and at what rate. TCP within the TCP/IP suite is the best-known example of the transport layer. This is where the communications select TCP port numbers to categorize and organize data transmissions across a network.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="layer3">
            <h2 >Layer 3. The network layer</h2>
            <p>The primary function of the network layer is to move data into and through other networks. Network layer protocols accomplish this by packaging data with correct network address information, selecting the appropriate network routes and forwarding the packaged data up the stack to the transport layer. From a TCP/IP perspective, this is where IP addresses are applied for routing purposes.</p>
        </section>      

        <section id="layer2">
            <h2 >Layer 2. The data-link layer </h2>
            <p>The data-link, or protocol layer, in a program handles moving data into and out of a physical link in a network. This layer handles problems that occur as a result of bit transmission errors. It ensures that the pace of the data flow doesn't overwhelm the sending and receiving devices. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="layer1">
            <h2 >Layer 1. The physical layer </h2>
            <p>The physical layer transports data using electrical, mechanical or procedural interfaces. This layer is responsible for sending computer bits from one device to another along the network. It determines how physical connections to the network are set up and how bits are represented into predictable signals as they're transmitted either electrically, optically or via radio waves.</p>
