        The meta viewport tag helps attendees for creating a responsive web design that adapts to various devices, including both desktop and mobile.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let's break the code and dive deep how it is working
        <br>
          1. width=device-width: This part sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device, allowing your website to adapt to the screen size of the user's device.
        <br>
          2. initial-scale=1.0: This sets the initial zoom level of the webpage to 100%, meaning it doesn't zoom in or out when the page is loaded. This ensures that your content appears at its intended size on the user's device, regardless of the screen size.
        <br>
        <br>
            With the viewport meta tag in place, your website becomes compatible with a wide range of devices, from desktops and laptops to tablets and smartphones. Users can access your content with ease, no matter what device they are using.
