            <p> Did you know: The average worker makes five to seven career changes in their lifetime. It is not a question of if you are going to have a career change but when.</p>

            <p>So, we tapped the brilliant minds of Rebekah D. Gordon, J.D., the UX design and strategy lead at JPMorgan Chase and a General Assembly bootcamp grad, and Candace Rogue, a UX educator, designer and developer, and a UX lead instructor at General Assembly, to debunk the biggest myths about making a career change into tech—using their own first-hand experiences</p>
           
            <h2>Journey 1:</h2>
            <p>Rebekah originally wanted to be a neuroscientist, but failed a chemistry course in college, so she pivoted to political science. During her undergrad, she started a digital marketing firm before going to law school and becoming a lawyer. Early in her law career, Gordon realized she missed doing creative work and wasn’t ready to give that up, so she left her high-paying lawyer job and enrolled in a full-time 12-week General Assembly’s UX Design Bootcamp, where more than 40,000 alumni from full-time and part-time courses have acquired the skills they need to make a career change or advance their careers to find a career they love that also loves them back.</p>
           
            <h2>Journey 2:</h2>
            <p>Candace also had a non-linear career path. She started out in fashion, working as an operations manager for Saks Fifth Avenue and a merchandising coordinator for Levi’s and Adidas. Her UX career began during her fashion days: Rogue did a software engineering bootcamp with another online course provider, then she joined General Assembly as an instructor through a friend that she used to work with at a startup</p>

            <h2>Finally</h2>
            <p>These two UX powerhouses are proof that it is never too late to start your tech career. Trust, they have been there.</p>
