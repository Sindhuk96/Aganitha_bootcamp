# Role of Frontend web Developer

According to me a good frontend developer develops a website which defines the purpose of website, allows clients, admins and everyone to have easy and clean access on UI part

Coming to Development part, developer should focus on readable and easily maintainable code also should know clear requirements and work on them. Should have clear idea on what to code what not to code for new features as it increases the complexity of project incase of wrong decisions.
